(Windows) PyInstaller now attempts to preserve parent directory structure
of DLLs that are collected from python packages (e.g., bundled with
packages in PyPI wheels) instead of collecting them to the top-level
application directory. This behavior might be incompatible with 3rd
party hooks that assume the old behavior, and may result in duplication
of DLL files or missing DLLs in hook-provided runtime search paths.
