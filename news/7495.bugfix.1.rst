Extend the ``excludedimports`` mechanism rework from :issue:`7066`
to properly handle the case of multiple submodules being imported in a
single ``from ... import ...`` statement (using absolute or relative import).
For example, when package ``c`` does ``from d import e, f``, we need to
consider potential ``excludedimports`` rules matching package ``d`` and,
if ``d`` itself is not excluded, potential rules individually matching
``d.e`` and ``d.f``.
