Add automatic binary vs. data file (re)classification step to the
analysis process. PyInstaller now inspects all files passed to ``Analysis``
via ``datas`` and ``binaries`` arguments, as well as all files returned
by hooks via ``datas`` and ``binaries`` hook global variables. The
inspection mechanism is platform-specific, and currently implemented for
Windows, Linux, and macOS. Proper file classification ensures that all
collected binary files undergo binary dependency analysis and any other
platform-specific binary processing. On macOS, it also helps ensuring
that the collected files are placed in the proper directory in the
generated .app bundles.
