If the entry-point script has no suffix, append the ``.py`` suffix
to the filename passed to the ``compile`` function when byte-compiling
the script for collection. This ensures that the entry-point script
filename never coincides with executable filename, especially in POSIX
builds, where executables have no suffix either (and their name is based
on the entry-point script basename by default). Entry-point script having
the same filename as the executable causes issues when ``traceback``
(and ``linecache``) try to access source code for it, an in the process
end up reading the executable file if it happens to be in the current
working directory.
