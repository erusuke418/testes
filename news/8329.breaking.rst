PyInstaller now explicitly disallows attempts to collect multiple Qt
bindings packages (``PySide2``, ``PySide6``, ``PyQt5``, ``PyQt6``) into
a frozen application. When hooks for more than one top-level Qt bindings
package are executed, the build process is aborted with error message.
This restriction applies across all instances of ``Analysis`` within
a single build (i.e., a single .spec file).

If you encounter build errors caused by this new restriction, either
clean up your build environment (remove the bindings that you are not
using), or explicitly exclude the extraneous bindings using :option:`--exclude`
(or equivalent ``excludes`` list passed as argument to ``Analysis`` in
the .spec file).

The automatic exclusion of extraneous bindings needs to be done via hooks
on per-package basis, so please report problematic packages on PyInstaller's
issue tracker, so that we can write hooks for them.
