(POSIX) Bootloader now attempts to create the run-time temporary
directory given via :option:`--runtime-tmpdir` option (instead of
requiring the directory to already exist), in order to match the
behavior on Windows. A relative run-time temporary directory is now
resolved to an absolute full path before being used to construct the
application's temporary directory path.
