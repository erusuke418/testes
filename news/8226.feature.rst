Implement strict Qt dependency validation for collection of Qt plugins
and QML components/plugins. We now perform preliminary binary dependency
analysis of the plugins, and automatically exclude plugins that
have at least one missing Qt dependency. This prevents collection of
plugins that cannot be used anyway because of a missing Qt shared library
(that is, for example, omitted from a PyPI wheel). Furthermore, we disallow
Qt dependencies of a plugin to be resolved outside of the primary location
of Qt shared libraries, in order to prevent missing dependencies from
pulling in Qt libraries from alternative locations that happen to be in
the search path (for example, when using ``PyQt5`` PyPI wheels while also
having a system-installed Qt5 on Linux, a Homebrew-installed Qt5 on macOS,
or a custom Windows Qt5 build that happens to be in ``PATH``).
