When setting up embedded Python interpreter configuration, set
``PyConfig.install_signal_handlers=1`` to install signal handlers.
This matches the behavior of PyInstaller 5.x bootloaders, where interpreter
was initialized via ``Py_Initialize()``, which in turn calls
``Py_InitializeEx(1)``, i.e., with ``install_sigs=1``.
