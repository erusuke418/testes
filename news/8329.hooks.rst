PyInstaller now explicitly disallows attempts to collect multiple Qt
bindings packages (``PySide2``, ``PySide6``, ``PyQt5``, ``PyQt6``) into
a frozen application. When hooks for more than one top-level Qt bindings
package are executed, the build process is aborted with error message
that informs user of the situation and what to do about it (i.e., exclusion
of extraneous packages). The limitation applies to all analyses within a
spec file.
