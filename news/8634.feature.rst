Introduce new ``PYINSTALLER_RESET_ENVIRONMENT`` environment variable,
to be used by application developers when trying to launch
``sys.executable``-based process that is supposed to outlive the
current application process (which includes the application restart scenario).
This is considered the official and preferred approach at spawning
new independent instances of the same application (as opposed to
modifying the private ``_PYI_ARCHIVE_FILE`` environment variable).
