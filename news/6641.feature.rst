Add an optional ``always_on_top`` boolean argument to the ``Splash`` class.
This allows users to disable the always-on-top behavior of the splash
screen for their application in order to make it less obnoxious.
By default, the always-on-top behavior is enabled for the sake of
consistency with earlier releases.
