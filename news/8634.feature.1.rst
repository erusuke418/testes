The splash screen in splash-screen enabled frozen application can now
be disabled by the user at run-time, using the new
``PYINSTALLER_SUPPRESS_SPLASH_SCREEN`` environment variable. If the
environment variable is set to ``1``, the splash screen is not shown,
and functions from mod:`pyi_splash` become no-op without raising errors
or displaying warning messages.
