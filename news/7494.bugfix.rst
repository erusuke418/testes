Reorganize the ``multiprocessing`` run-time hook to override ``Popen``
implementations only for ``spawn`` and ``forkserver`` start methods,
but not for the ``fork`` start method. This avoids a dead-lock when
attempting to perform nested multiprocessing using the ``fork`` start
method, which occurred due to override-provided lock (introduced in
:issue:`7411`) being copied in its locked state into the forked
sub-process.
