(Windows) In ``windowed``/``noconsole`` mode, stop setting ``sys.stdout``
and ``sys.stderr`` to custom ``NullWriter`` object, and instead leave
them at ``None``. This matches the behavior of windowed python interpreter
(``pythonw.exe``) and prevents interoperability issues with code that
(rightfully) expects the streams to be either ``None`` or objects that
are fully compatible with ``io.IOBase``.
