Prevent PyInstaller runtime hook for ``setuptools`` from attempting to
override ``distutils`` with ``setuptools``-provided version when
``setuptools`` is collected and its version is lower than 60.0. This
both mimics the unfrozen behavior and prevents errors on versions
between 50.0 and 60.0, where we do not explicitly collect
``setuptools._distutils``.
