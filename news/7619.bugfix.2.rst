(macOS) In generated .app bundles, the source .py files are now again
relocated to ``Contents/Resources`` directory (and cross-linked into
``Contents/Frameworks``), which ensures that code-signing does not
store signatures into the files' extended attributes. This reverts the
exemption made in :issue:`7180` to accommodate the ``cv2`` loader script;
the problem is now solved by cross-linking binaries from
``Contents/Frameworks`` to ``Contents/Resources``, which allows the
loader to find the extension binary (or rather, a symbolic link to it)
next to the .py file.
