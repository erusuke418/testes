(Linux) Have ``glib`` runtime hook prepend the frozen application's data
dir to the ``XDG_DATA_DIRS`` environment variable instead of completely
overwriting it. This should fix the case when ``xdg-open`` is used to
launch a system-installed application (for example, opening an URL in a
web browser via the ``webbrowser`` module) and no registered applications
being found.
