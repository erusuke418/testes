(Windows) In debug-enabled bootloader variants, copies of debug/warning/error
messages are now submitted to ``OutputDebugString`` win32 API in addition
to their primary output mechanism (i.e., ``stderr`` or message dialog).
This applies to both console and noconsole/windowed bootloader variants.
(Previously, ``OutputDebugString`` was used only for debug messages in
debug-enabled noconsole/windowed bootloader variant, where it serves as
the primary output mechanism.)
