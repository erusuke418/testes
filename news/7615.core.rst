Remove the use of the ``TOC`` class in the analysis / build process,
and use plain ``list`` instances instead. The implicit normalization
(de-duplication) of TOC entries performed by the ``TOC`` class has been
replaced with explicit normalization. The TOC lists produced by ``Analysis``
are explicitly normalized at the end of Analysis instantiation, before
they are stored in the Analysis properties (e.g., ``Analysis.pure``,
``Analysis.binaries``, ``Analysis.datas``). Similarly, the TOC lists
passed to the build targets (e.g., ``PYZ``, ``EXE``, ``COLLECT``) are
explicitly normalized as part of the targets' instantiation process.
