The ``__file__`` attribute in the ``__main__`` module (entry-point
script) is now set to the absolute file name inside the ``_MEIPASS``
(as if script file existed there) instead of just script filename.
This better matches the behavior of ``__file__`` in the unfrozen script,
but might break the existing code that explicitly relies on the old
frozen behavior.
