Extend the ``excludedimports`` mechanism rework from :issue:`7066`
to properly handle relative imports within the package. For example,
ensure that ``excludedimports = ['a.b']`` within the hook for package
``a`` takes effect when package ``a`` does ``from . import b`` (in
addition to ``from a import b``).
