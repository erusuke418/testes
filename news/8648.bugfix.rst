(Windows) Fix regression in PyInstaller 6.x that caused console-enabled
onefile applications fail to clean up their temporary directory during
system session shutdown (i.e., when user logs off or initiates system
shutdown or restart). For console-enabled onefile applications, this
used to work up until PyInstaller 6.0 by means of installed console
handler; however, due to contemporary bootloader executables being linked
against ``user32.dll``, the console handler does not receive ``CTRL_LOGOFF_EVENT``
and ``CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT`` console events anymore (for the same reason,
this did not work for builds with splash screen, even between v5.3 and
6.0). Instead, session shutdown needs to be handled by means of hidden
window and handling of ``WM_QUERYENDSESSION`` and ``WM_ENDSESSION`` event
messages.
