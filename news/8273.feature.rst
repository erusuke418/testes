(Linux) Collect ``.hmac`` files accompanying shared libraries, if such
files are available. This allows frozen application to run on FIPS-enabled
Red Hat Enterprise systems, where HMAC is required by self-check
implemented by the OpenSSL crypto library. Furthermore, ensure that
shared libraries with accompanying ``.hmac`` files are exempted from
any additional processing (for example, when building with ``--strip``
option) to avoid invalidating the HMAC.
