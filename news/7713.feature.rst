Restructure onedir mode builds so that everything except the executable (and
``.pkg`` if you're using external PYZ archive mode) are hidden inside a
sub-directory. This sub-directory's name defaults to ``_internal`` but may be
configured with the new :option:`--internals-prefix` option. Onefile
applications and macOS ``.app`` bundles are unaffected.
