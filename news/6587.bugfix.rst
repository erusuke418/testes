(macOS) Limit the strict architecture validation for collected binaries to
extension modules only. Fixes architecture validation errors when a
``universal2`` package has its multi-arch extension modules' arch slices
linked against distinct single-arch thin shared libraries, as is the
case with ``scipy`` 1.8.0 macOS ``universal2`` wheel.
