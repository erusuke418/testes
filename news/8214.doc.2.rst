Add a new documentation chapter, called :ref:`common issues`, to cover
topics such as launching external programs from frozen applications,
multi-processing via :mod:`multiprocessing` (specifically, the requirement
to call :func:`multiprocessing.freeze_support`), use of symbolic links in
POSIX builds in PyInstaller >= 6.0 and its implications for distribution
(e.g., when copying frozen application, or creating ``zip`` archives),
``sys.stdout`` and ``sys.stderr`` being ``None`` in Windows no-console
builds.
