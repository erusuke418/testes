(Windows) The ``onefile`` parent process now sets up invisible window
to receive and handle ``WM_QUERYENDSESSION`` and ``WM_ENDSESSION``
event messages, which allows it properly clean up temporary files during
session shutdown (i.e., user logging off, or initiating system shutdown
or restart). Cleanup during session shutdown should now work in both
console-enabled and windowed/noconsole builds, and regardless of whether
splash screen is used or not.
