(macOS) The file relocation mechanism in ``BUNDLE`` that generates
macOS .app bundles has been completely redesigned. All data files are
now placed into directory structure rooted in ``Contents/Resources``,
all shared libraries (as well as nested .framework bundles) are placed
into directory structure rooted in ``Contents/Frameworks``, and only
the the program executable is placed into the ``Contents/MacOS``
directory. The contents of ``Contents/Resources`` and ``Contents/Frameworks``
directories are cross-linked between the two directory trees in
order to maintain illusion of mixed-content directories (in both
directory trees). The cross-linking is done at either file level or
(sub)directory level, depending on the content type of a (sub)directory.
For directories in ``Contents/Frameworks`` that contain a dot in the name,
a work-around is automatically applied: the directory is created with a
modified name that does not include the dot, and next to it, a symbolic
link is created under the original name and pointing to the directory
with modified name.
