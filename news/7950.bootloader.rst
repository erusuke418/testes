(Linux, macOS) When extracting files from ``onefile`` archive, the
executable bit is now set only on binaries (files whose TOC type code
was either ``BINARY``, ``EXECUTABLE``, or ``EXTENSION``). Therefore,
binaries are now extracted with permissions bits set to ``0700``, while
all other files have permissions bits set to ``0600``.
