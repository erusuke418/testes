Add a splash screen that displays a background image and text:
The splash screen can be controlled from within Python using the ``pyi_splash`` module.
A splash screen can be added using the ``--splash IMAGE_FILE`` option.
If optional text is enabled, the splash screen will show the progress of unpacking in
onefile mode.
This feature is supported only on Windows and Linux.
