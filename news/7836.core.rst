Avoid collecting ``pathlib`` and ``tokenize`` (and their dependencies,
such as ``urllib``) into ``base_library.zip``. By collecting them into
PYZ archive, only submodules that the application really requires can
be collected, which helps reducing the size of applications that, for
example, do not require the full ``urllib`` package.
