(macOS) Disable processing of Apple events for the purpose of argv emulation
in ``onedir`` application bundles. This functionality was introduced in
|PyInstaller| 4.4 by (:issue:`#5920`) in response to feature requests
(:issue:`#5436`) and (:issue:`#5908`), but was discovered to be breaking
``tkinter``-based ``onedir`` bundles made with Homebrew python 3.9 and
Tcl/Tk 8.6.11 (:issue:`#6043`). As such, until the cause is investigated
and the issue addressed, this feature is reverted/disabled.
