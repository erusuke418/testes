(macOS) Fix the bug in binary processing and caching that would update
the binary cache index before performing macOS-specific processing
(architecture validation, path rewriting). If, for example, architecture
validation failed during a build, subsequent build attempts with
enabled binary cache (i.e., without the :option:`--clean` option) would
pick up the partially-processed binary file from the cache, bypassing the
architecture validation. NOTE: the existing binary caches need to be
purged manually (using :option:`--clean` option once) for the fix to take
effect!
