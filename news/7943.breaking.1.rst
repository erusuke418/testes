The collection of "py files", enabled by the ``include_py_files=True``
argument to the :func:`PyInstaller.utils.hooks.collect_data_files` hook
utility function, is now restricted to only ``.py`` and ``.pyc`` files.
Previously, all suffices from ``importlib.machinery.all_suffices``were
enabled, which resulted in spurious collection of dynamic libraries and
extensions (due to ``.so``, ``.abi3.so``, ``.pyd``, etc. being among
those suffices).
