(macOS) PyInstaller now attempts to preserve the .framework bundles when
collecting shared libraries from them. If a shared library is to be
collected from a .framework bundle, the ``Info.plist`` is also
automatically collected. The .framework bundle collection code also
attempts to fix the bundles' structure to conform to code-signing
requirements (i.e., creation of the ``Current`` symbolic link in the
``Versions`` directory, and top-level contents being symbolic links that
point to counterparts in the ``Versions/Current`` directory). Note that
other resources (for example from ``Resources`` or ``Helpers`` directories)
still need to be explicitly collected by hooks.
