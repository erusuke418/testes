(macOS) Ensure that the macOS SDK version reported by the frozen application
corresponds to the minimum of the SDK version used to build the bootloader
and the SDK version used to build the Python library. Having the application
report more recent version than Python library and other bundled libraries
may result in macOS attempting to enable additional features that are not
available in the Python library, which may in turn cause inconsistent behavior
and UI issues with ``tkinter``.
