(Windows) Fix Qt run-time hooks failing to add the top-level application
directory to ``PATH`` when the latter already contains a sub-directory
of the top-level application directory (for example, ``pywin32_system32``
sub-directory added to ``PATH`` by ``pywin32`` run-time hook). This
failure prevented QtNetwork from discovering bundled OpenSSL DLLs, and 
caused it to (attempt to) load them from other locations that happened
to be in ``PATH``.
