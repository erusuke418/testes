(Windows) Removed support for analyzing and collection of dependencies
referenced via WinSxS (side-by-side) assemblies. This affects binaries
compiled with Visual Studio 2008 and earlier, as VC9 run-time was the
last version to make use of WinSxS. If you require support for such
binaries and you need referenced WinSxS binaries collected with your
application, use older version of PyInstaller.
