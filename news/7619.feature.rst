Implement support for creating symbolic links from special ``'SYMLINK'``
TOC entries, either at build-time (``onedir`` mode) or at run-time
(``onefile`` mode). Implement symbolic link preservation support in
the analysis process; if a file and a symbolic link pointing to it are
both to be collected, and if their relative relationship is preserved
in the frozen application, the symbolic link is collected as a ``'SYMLINK'``
entry.
