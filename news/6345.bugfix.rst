(Windows) Implement a work-around for running PyInstaller under python
process with ``-OO`` (or ``PYTHONOPTIMIZE=2``) with ``cffi`` installed.
We now temporarily disable import of ``cffi`` while importing
``pywin32-ctypes`` in ``PyInstaller.compat`` to ensure that ``ctypes``
backend is always used, as the ``cffi`` backend uses ``pycparser`` and
requires docstrings, which makes it incompatible with the ``-OO`` mode.
