(macOS) Use macOS-provided ``install_name_tool`` utility to modify headers
on collected binaries: change the dylib identifier to ``@rpath/<name>.dylib``,
rewrite paths to linked non-system shared libraries to ``@rpath/<dependency>``,
remove any additional rpaths and add an rpath pointing to the application's
top-level directory, relative to the ``@loader_path``. Previously, the
header modification was performed using ``macholib`` and was limited
only to modification of dylib identifier and paths to linked non-system
shared libraries.
