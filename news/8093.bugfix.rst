Fix matching of pre-release versions in
:func:`PyInstaller.utils.hooks.check_requirement` and
:func:`PyInstaller.utils.hooks.is_module_satisfies`. Both functions now
match pre-release versions, which restores the behavior of the old
``pkg_resources``-based implementation from PyInstaller < 6.0
that is implicitly expected by existing hooks.
