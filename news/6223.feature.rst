(Windows) Embed the manifest into generated ``onedir`` executables by
default, in order to avoid potential issues when user renames the executable
(e.g., the manifest not being found anymore due to activation context
caching when user renames the executable and attempts to run it before
also renaming the manifest file). The old behavior of generating the
external manifest file in ``onedir`` mode can be re-enabled using the
:option:`--no-embed-manifest` command-line switch, or via the
``embed_manifest=False`` argument to ``EXE()`` in the .spec file.
