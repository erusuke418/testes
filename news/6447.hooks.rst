Avoid collecting the whole ``QtQml`` module and its dependencies in cases
when it is not necessary (i.e., the application does not use ``QtQml`` or
``QtQuick`` modules). The unnecessary collection was triggered due to
extension modules being linked against the ``libQt5Qml`` or ``libQt6Qml``
shared library, and affected pure widget-based applications (``PySide2``
and ``PySide6`` on Linux) and widget-based applications that use
``QtWebEngineWidgets`` (``PySide2``, ``PySide6``, ``PyQt5``, and ``PyQt6``
on all OSes).
