(Windows) Limit the DLL parent path preservation behavior from :issue:``
to files collected from site-packages directories (as returned by
``site.getsitepackages`` and ``site.getusersitepackages``) instead of all paths
in ``sys.path``, to avoid unintended behavior in corner cases, such as
``sys.path`` containing the drive root or user's home directory.
