Implemented explicit tracking of (sub)process level via newly-introduced
``_PYI_PARENT_PROCESS_LEVEL`` environment variable. This allows us to
reliably distinguish between different process types: in ``onedir``
applications, between the main application process and worker sub-process(es)
spawned via ``sys.executable``; in ``onefile`` applications, between the
parent process, the main application process, and worker sub-process(es)
spawned via ``sys.executable``.
