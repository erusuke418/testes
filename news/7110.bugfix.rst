Fix the problem with ``pywin32`` DLLs not being found when importing
``pywin32`` top-level extension modules, caused by the DLL directory
structure preservation behavior introduced in :issue:`7028`. Introduce
a new bootstrap/loader module that adds the ``pywin32_system32``
directory, if available, to both ``sys.path`` and the DLL search paths,
in lieu of having to provide a runtime hook script for every single
top-level extension module from ``pywin32``.
