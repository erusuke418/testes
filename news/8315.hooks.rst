Have run-time hooks for Qt bindings (``PySide2``, ``PySide6``, ``PyQt5``,
and ``PyQt6``) check for presence of the embedded ``:/qt/etc/qt.conf``
resource, and if not present, inject their own version. This
aims to ensure that the bundled Qt is always relocatable, even if the
package does not perform injection of embedded ``qt.conf`` file (most
notably, this seems to be the case with ``PySide2`` collected from
Linux distribution packages, and ``PySide2`` collected from Anaconda
on Windows, Linux, and macOS).
