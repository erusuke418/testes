(Linux) Ignore the executable name resolution based on ``/proc/self/exe``
when the PyInstaller-frozen executable is launched via the ``ld.so``
dynamic loader executable. In such cases, the resolved name points to
the ``ld.so`` executable, causing the PyInstaller-frozen executable to
fail with *Cannot open PyInstaller archive from executable...* error.
