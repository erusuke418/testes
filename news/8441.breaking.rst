PyInstaller does not attempt to expand environment variables in paths
given via :option:`--workpath`, :option:`--distpath`, :option:`--specpath`,
and :option:`--additional-hooks-dir` anymore (note that other paths were
never subject to environment variable expansion in the first place).
Expansion of the starting tilde (``~``) into user's home directory is
still performed, as a work-around for tilde not being expanded by the
shell when passing arguments as ``--workpath=~/path/abc`` instead of
``--workpath ~/path/abc``.
