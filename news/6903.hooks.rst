(macOS) Disable ``QtWebEngine`` sandboxing for Qt6 in the corresponding
``PySide6`` and ``PyQt6`` run-time hooks as a work-around for the
``QtWebEngineProcess`` helper process crashing. This is required as of
Qt 6.3.1 due to the way PyInstaller collects Qt libraries, but is applied
regardless of the used Qt6 version. If you are using an older version of
Qt6 and would like to keep the sandboxing, reset the
``QTWEBENGINE_DISABLE_SANDBOX`` environment variable at the start of your
program, before importing Qt packages.
