(POSIX) Fix ``PyInstaller.depend.bindepend.resolve_library_path`` for
cases when ``ldconfig`` cache is not available (e.g., ``musl libc`` on
Alpine Linux). In such cases, the search code now distinguishes between
the case when fully suffixed library name is given (i.e., search for
exact match) and the case when library name has no suffix (i.e., search
for library with matching basename).
