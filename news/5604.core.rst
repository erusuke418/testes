Collect python extension modules that correspond to built-ins into
``lib-dynload`` sub-directory instead of directly into bundle's root
directory. This prevents them from shadowing shared libraries with the
same basename that are located in a package and loaded via ``ctypes`` or
``cffi``, and also declutters the bundle's root directory.
