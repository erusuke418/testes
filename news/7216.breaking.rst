(Windows) In ``windowed``/``noconsole`` mode, PyInstaller does not set
``sys.stdout`` and ``sys.stderr`` to custom ``NullWriter`` object anymore,
but leaves them at ``None``. The new behavior matches that of the windowed
python interpreter (``pythonw.exe``), but may break the code that uses
``sys.stdout`` or ``sys.stderr`` without first checking that they are
available. The code intended to be run frozen in ``windowed``/``noconsole``
mode should be therefore be validated using the windowed python interpreter
to catch errors related to console being unavailable.
