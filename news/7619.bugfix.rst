Fix file duplication when collecting a file and symbolic links pointing
at it; with new symbolic link support, the symbolic links are now
properly preserved. This should help reducing the size of builds made
on Linux and macOS with Anaconda, which provides versioned symbolic
links for packaged shared libraries, and PyInstaller tends to collect
them all due to hook helper based on the packages' metadata.
