(macOS) Lower the severity of a missing ``Info.plist`` file in a
collected macOS .framework bundle from an error to a warning (unless
strict collection mode is enabled). While missing ``Info.plist`` in a
collected .framework bundle will cause ``codesign`` to refuse to sign
the generated .app bundle, the user might be interested in building
just the POSIX application or may not plan to sign their .app bundle.
Fixes building with old ``PyQt5`` PyPI wheels (< 5.14.1).
