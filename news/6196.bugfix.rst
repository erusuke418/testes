(Windows) Fix issues in ``onedir`` frozen applications when the bootloader
is compiled using a toolchain that forcibly embeds a default manifest
(e.g., the ``MinGW-w64`` toolchain from ``msys2``). The issues range from
manifest-related options (e.g., ``uac-admin``) not working to windowed frozen
application not starting at all (with the ``The procedure entry point
LoadIconMetric could not be located...`` error message).
