(macOS) The changes made to the macOS .app bundle generation code and the
resulting .app bundle structure (strict relocation of binaries to
``Contents/MacOS`` and data files to ``Contents/Resources``, bi-directional
cross-linking between ``Contents/MacOS`` and ``Contents/Resources``,
preservation of nested .framework bundles, automatic work-around for dots
in directory names) are likely incompatible with existing (external)
post-processing scripts.
