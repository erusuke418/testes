(macOS) The changes made to the macOS .app bundle generation code and the
resulting .app bundle structure (strict relocation of binaries to
``Contents/Frameworks`` and data files to ``Contents/Resources``,
bi-directional cross-linking between ``Contents/Frameworks`` and
``Contents/Resources``, preservation of nested .framework bundles,
automatic work-around for dots in directory names) are likely
incompatible with existing (external) post-processing scripts.
