Implement a mechanism that allows hooks to inform PyInstaller's binary
dependency analysis that it should not create symbolic links to top-level
application directory for certain shared libraries (applicable to platforms
where such symbolic links are created in the first place). This mechanism
is intended as a work around for corner cases when such symbolic links
disrupt run-time discovery of other shared libraries that are stored in
the linked library's true location.
