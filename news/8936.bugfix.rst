(macOS) Fix directory name sanitization when building macOS .app bundles
to properly account for nested .framework bundles, and prevent mangling
of .framework directory name of all but inner-most .framework bundles.
For example, the ``sdl2dll/dll/SDL2_image.framework`` directory from
``pysdl2-dll`` PyPI wheels would become mangled into
``sdl2dll/dll/SDL2_image__dot__framework`` due to having nested
.framework bundles in its ``Versions/A/Frameworks`` sub-directory.
