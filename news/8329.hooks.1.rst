Extend hooks for ``matplotlib`` to prevent collection of multiple
available Qt bindings. The new hook for ``matplotlib.backends.qt_compat``
attempts to select a single Qt bindings package via the following
logic implemented in the ``PyInstaller.utils.hooks.qt.exclude_extraneous_qt_bindings``
helper: first, we check if hooks for any Qt bindings package have already
been run; if they had, those bindings are selected. If not, we check for
user-specified bindings in the ``QT_API`` environment variable; if valid
bindings name is specified, those bindings are selected. Otherwise, we
select one of available bindings. Once a Qt bindings package is selected,
the imports of all other Qt bindings packages are excluded from the
hooked package.
