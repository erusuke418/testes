(macOS) In generated .app bundles, the data files from ``PySide2``,
``PySide6``, ``PyQt5``, or ``PyQt6`` directory are now relocated to
the directory structure rooted in ``Contents/Resources`` to ensure
compliance with code-signing requirements. The content cross-linking
between ``Contents/Resources`` and ``Contents/Frameworks`` should ensure
that ``QML`` components in the ``qml`` sub-directory continue to work in
spite of plugins (shared libraries) being technically separated from
their corresponding metadata files. The automatic-work around for directories
with dots in names should prevent code-signing issues due to some ``QML``
components in Qt5 having dot in their names (e.g., ``QtQuick.2`` and
``QtQuick/Controls.2``.
