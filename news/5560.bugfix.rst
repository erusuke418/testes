(Windows) Prevent PyInstaller's binary dependency analysis from looking
for shared libraries in all ``sys.path`` locations. Instead, search
only ``sys.base_prefix`` and ``pywin32`` directories, of available.
This, for example,  prevents PyInstaller from picking up incompatible
DLLs from system-installed programs that happen to put their installation
directory into system-wide ``PYTHONPATH``.
