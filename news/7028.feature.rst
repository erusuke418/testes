(Windows) When collecting a DLL that was discovered via link-time
dependency analysis of a collected binary/extension, attempt to preserve
its parent directory structure instead of collecting it into application's
top-level directory. This aims to preserve the parent directory structure
of DLLs bundled with python packages in PyPI wheels, while the DLLs
collected from system directories (as well as from ``Library\bin``
directory of the Anaconda's environment) are still collected into
top-level application directory.
