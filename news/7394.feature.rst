Compile the collected GLib schema files using ``glib-schema-compiler``
instead of collecting the pre-compiled ``gschemas.compiled`` file, in
order to properly support collection of schema files from multiple
locations. Do not collect the source schema files anymore, as only
``gschemas.compiled`` file should be required at run time.
