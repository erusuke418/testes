Implement proper binary dependency scanning in the ``SPLASH`` target,
so that binary dependencies of the Tcl and Tk shared libraries are
always collected and added to the list of splash requirements
(for pre-extraction in onefile builds). This fixes the splash screen
when building with Windows build of python.org Python 3.12b1, which
ships Tcl shared library with new dependency on ``zlib1.dll``.
