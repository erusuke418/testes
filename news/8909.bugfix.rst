Rework the ``localpycs`` cache in the ``build`` directory to avoid relying
on the source .py file timestamps. Some package managers (e.g., Anaconda)
(re)set the file creation/modification time of installed files to the
time of packaging rather than having them reflect the time of installation;
therefore, the PyInstaller bootstrap script and modules would fail to be
properly recompiled when switching between different versions of
PyInstaller packaged by Anaconda.
