(Windows) Improve handling of ``CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT`` console event in
``onefile`` builds for compatibility with Windows Terminal in order to
avoid leaking temporary files when user closes the terminal window
(or tab). Upon receiving the event, the parent process now gives the child
process a 500-millisecond grace period to exit, after which it terminates
the child process and proceeds with the cleanup (previously, the parent
process indefinitely waited for the child to exit, under assumption that
the ``CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT`` will also cause the child to exit at the same
time - which was the case with ``conhost.exe``, but is not the case with
Windows Terminal, where the child appears to receive event only after
OS already terminated the parent process).
