The :func:`PyInstaller.utils.hooks.is_module_satisfies` helper does not
support the ``version`` and ``version_attribute`` arguments anymore; the
function will raise an error if they are specified. If the distribution
specified in the ``requirements`` string is not found, the function will
not attempt to import the eponymous module and read its version attribute
anymore.
