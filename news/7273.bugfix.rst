Fix potential duplication of python extension modules in ``onefile``
builds, which happened when an extension was collected both as an
``EXTENSION`` and as a ``DATA`` (or a ``BINARY``) TOC type. This
resulted in run-time warnings about files already existing; the
most notorious example being ``WARNING: file already exists but
should not: C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\MEI1234567\torch\_C.cp39-win_amd64.pyd``
when building ``onefile`` applications that use ``torch``.
