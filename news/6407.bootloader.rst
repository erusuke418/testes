Implement single-process ``onedir`` mode for Linux and Unix-like OSes as a
replacement for previously-used two-process implementation. The new mode 
uses ``exec()`` without ``fork()`` to restart the bootloader executable
image within the same process after setting up the environment (i.e., the
``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` and other environment variables).
