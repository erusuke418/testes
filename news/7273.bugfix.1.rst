Fix the problem with ``MERGE`` not properly cleaning up passed
``Analysis.binaries`` and ``Analysis.datas`` TOCs due to changes made to
``TOC`` class in PyInstaller 5.0. This effectively broke the supposed
de-duplication functionality of ``MERGE`` and multi-package bundles,
which should be restored now.
