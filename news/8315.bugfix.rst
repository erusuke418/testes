(Linux) Fix collection of ``QtWebEngineProcess`` helper when collecting
Qt (and ``PySide``/``PyQt`` bindings) installed via Linux distribution
packages. In such scenarios, we now force collection of the helper
executable into ``libexec`` directory inside the Qt sub-directory of
the bindings' package directory, in order to match the PyPI wheel layout.
