(Windows) Implement last-ditch attempt at force-unloading bundled DLLs
from onefile parent process: if onefile application fails to remove its
temporary directory, it now iterates over all DLLs loaded in the process,
identifies the ones that originate from its temporary directory, and
attempts to force-unload them, before trying to remove the temporary
directory again. This should work around for issues with Tcl/Tk DLLs
used by splash screen, which may load additional DLLs, and fail to
automatically unload them when they are unloaded themselves.
