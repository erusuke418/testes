(Windows) Explicitly set ``NTDDI_VERSION=0x06010000`` and
``_WIN32_WINNT=0x0601`` when compiling Windows bootloaders to request
Windows 7 feature level for Windows headers. The windowed bootloader
requires at least Windows Vista feature level, and some toolchains
(e.g., mingw cross-compiler on linux) set too low level by default.
