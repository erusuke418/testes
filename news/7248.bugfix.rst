(Anaconda) Fix the ``PyInstaller.utils.hooks.conda.collect_dynamic_libs`` 
hook utility function to collect only dynamic libraries, by introducing 
an additional type check (to exclude directories and symbolic links to 
directories) and additional suffix check (to include only files whose 
name matches the following patterns: ``*.dll``, ``*.dylib``, ``*.so``, 
and ``*.so.*``).
