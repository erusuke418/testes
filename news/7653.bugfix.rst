Changes made to ``datas`` and ``binaries`` lists that are passed to
``Analysis`` constructor will now invalidate the cached ``Analysis``
and trigger a re-build. This applies both to changes made by editing
the .spec file manually and to automatic changes due to addition or
removal of corresponding command-line options (:option:`--add-data`,
:option:`--add-binaries`, :option:`--collect-data`,
:option:`--collect-binaries`, :option:`--copy-metadata`).
Previously, changes might not have taken effect as the old cached build
was returned if available and unless user explicitly requested a clean
build using the :option:`--clean` command-line option.
