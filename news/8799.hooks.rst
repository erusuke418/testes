Update and modernize PyInstaller's copy of ``numpy`` hook for compatibility
with ``numpy`` 1.24.x, 1.25.x, 1.26x, and 2.x. Set the priority of
PyInstaller's copy of ``numpy`` hook to 1 (using the new hook priority
mechanism from :issue:`8740`), so that it overrides the upstream hook, in
attempt to address the following issues:

- fix duplication of shared libraries bundled with ``numpy`` < 1.26
  PyPI wheels on Windows, which is caused by changed behavior of
  PyInstaller's binary dependency analysis in PyInstaller 6.x (both the
  old version of PyInstaller's numpy hook and its upstream counterpart
  were written for behavior of v5 and earlier).

- avoid triggering a warning about ``numpy`` base dist not being
  found when using ``pip``-installed ``numpy`` with Anaconda python.

- with ``numpy`` >= 1.26 on Windows, collect the load-order file from
  ``numpy.libs`` directory (if available) along with the shared libraries.
  This should minimize potential issues when using ``pip``-installed
  ``numpy`` >= 1.26 with Anaconda python 3.8 and 3.9.
