Fix regression on platforms with strict data alignment requirements
(such as linux on `armhf`/`armv7`), caused by bug in PKG/CArchive
generation that was introduced during the archive writer code cleanup.
The regression caused executable to terminate with ``Bus error`` on
the affected platforms, such as 32-bit Debian Buster on Raspberry Pi 4.
