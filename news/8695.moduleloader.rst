The ``PyiFrozenImporter`` has been reworked from being a monolithic
`meta path finder <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-meta-path-finder>`_
(with fused `loader <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-loader>`_ part)
into path-instanced `path entry finder <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-entry-finder>`_
(with fused loader part), registered with python's default
`path based finder <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-based-finder>`_.
The new path-instanced design enables proper handling of run-time :data:`sys.path`
modifications; i.e., modules within the PYZ archive can now be resolved
based on entries in :data:`sys.path` that are anchored to the top-level
application directory (``sys._MEIPASS``). This in turn also facilitates
full support for PEP420 namespace packages that are split across
different :data:`sys.path` locations; both within the PYZ archive, on
filesystem within top-level application directory tree, and/or in
fully-external locations.
