Implement an option to explicitly specify the bytecode optimization level
for collected python code, independent of the optimization level in the
python process under which PyInstaller is running. At the .spec file level,
this is controlled by optional ``optimize`` argument in the ``Analysis``
constructor. At the CLI level, this is controlled by new
:option:`--optimize` command-line option, which sets the ``optimize``
argument for ``Analysis`` as well as :ref:`interpreter run-time options
<specifying python interpreter options>` in the generated spec file.
See :ref:`bytecode optimization level` for details.
