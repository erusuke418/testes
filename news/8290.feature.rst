(Windows) Make Windows implementation of PyInstaller's
``_pyi_rth_utils.tempdir.secure_mkdir`` (used by ``matplotlib`` and
``win32com`` run-time hooks to create temporary directories)
AppContainer-aware. If the process runs inside an AppContainer, the
temporary directory's DACL needs to explicitly include the AppContainerSID,
otherwise the directory becomes inaccessible to the process.
