Fix erroneous DLL parent path preservation when ``sys.base_prefix``
itself is a symbolic link. In such case, we need to exclude both
resolved and unresolved path variant for ``sys.base_prefix``, in order to
prevent either from ending up in the list of directories for which DLL
parent paths are preserved. Failing to do so, for example, caused
``_ctypes`` failing to load in an application build on Windows with
python installed via ``scoop``, due to ``libffi-8.dll`` having spuriously
preserved the parent directory path instead of being collected to top-level
application directory.
