(non-Windows) PyInstaller now attempts to preserve the parent directory
structure for shared libraries discovered and collected by the binary
dependency analysis, instead of automatically collecting them into the
top-level application directory. Due to library search path assumptions
made in various places, symbolic links to collected libraries are created
in the top-level application directory. This complements earlier work
(:issue:`7028`) that implemented DLL parent directory structure
preservation on Windows.
