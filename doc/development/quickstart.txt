Quick-start
=============================

* Our git repository is at https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller::

    git clone https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller

  - Development is done on the `develop` branch. Pull-request shall be filed
    against this branch.

  - Releases will reside on the `master` branch.

* Install required testing tools::

    pip install -r tests/requirements-tools.txt
    
* Commit often and in logical chunks. Try to make small patches, consistent
  increments. :ref:`»» Detailed Commit Guideline <Guidelines for Commits>`

* Provide tests that cover your changes and try to run the tests locally
  first.

* Reformatting code without functional changes will generally not be accepted
  (for rational see :issue:`2727`).

* Write meaningful commit messages in in the present tense, document what
  you’re doing and why.
  :ref:`»» Detailed Commit Message Rules <commit messages>`

* Submit pull-requests against the ``develop`` branch.

* For new files mind adding the copyright header, see
  |PyInstaller/init.py|_
  (also mind updating to the current year).
