Thanks so much for your contribution! In order to save everyone's time,
please make sure that your Pull Request meets these criteria (note that
you can open the PR and then go back and resolve these issues):

1. **Are my commit messages well-written**? Do I need to use a commit
   prefix or better explain my changes? Are there too many or too few
   commits? Note that it's *okay* not to be sure about these questions,
   but try to make sure that *you* feel good about the answers.
   
2. **If changing code, is it formatted?** Notably, are the lines that
   I changed compliant with PEP 8? Are they less than **80 characters**?
   We use automated tooling to ensure new code quality, but existing
   code doesn't always meet these guidelines, so it shouldn't be used
   as a reference.

3. **Is the copyright header present on new files?** Particularly
   when adding hooks.
   
4. **Is the code clear?** Have you tested it to make sure that it
   works?

Note that even if you don't follow all of these guidelines, we'd still
love to have your contribution, if at least for someone else to later
pick up. But following the guidelines initially will save everyone's
time and ensure that your PR is merged sooner.

Thanks again for contributing; it makes PyInstaller possible!
